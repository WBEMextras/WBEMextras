Purpose: This project (similar) contains a few scripts written in Korn shell to assist you in installing,
upgrading HP-SIM related software on HP-UX systems. A SIM Health Check script is also foreseen to inspect
the status of the software and some other basic checks including sending a test event to HP Support Centre.

An HTML file is included with more information on the pre-requisites and how to use these scripts.
